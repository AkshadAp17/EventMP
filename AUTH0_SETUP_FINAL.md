# Auth0 Setup - Final Step

## Your Auth0 Credentials
From your Auth0 dashboard screenshots, here are your exact credentials:

### 1. AUTH0_DOMAIN
```
dev-5eajbng8pxadccif.us.auth0.com
```

### 2. AUTH0_CLIENT_ID  
```
iDVI5ASB3P4nshhLFTWZvdoGAEpEcC8N
```

### 3. AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
- Go to your Auth0 Application Settings
- Look for the "Client Secret" field (it's hidden with dots)
- Click "Show" or the eye icon to reveal it
- Copy the entire secret key

### 4. AUTH0_BASE_URL
This is your Replit app URL. It should be something like:
```
https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co
```

## How to Add These to Replit

1. **Click the Lock icon (üîê) in your Replit sidebar** - this opens the Secrets tab
2. **Add four new secrets**:
   - Key: `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, Value: `dev-5eajbng8pxadccif.us.auth0.com`
   - Key: `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, Value: `iDVI5ASB3P4nshhLFTWZvdoGAEpEcC8N`
   - Key: `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`, Value: [copy from Auth0 dashboard]
   - Key: `AUTH0_BASE_URL`, Value: [your Replit app URL]

## What Happens Next
Once you add these secrets:
1. The app will automatically restart
2. Auth0 authentication will be enabled
3. The "Professional Sign In" button will work
4. Users can sign in with Google, GitHub, email, etc.
